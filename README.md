# nyse_data_project

This repository contains data of over four hundred stocks recorded in a span of four years. It involves:
- Summary statistics of an insight I found within the data
- A profit and loss statement dashboard, with the ability to choose any stock within the data and see what was collected all four years
- Forecast scenarios of the NVDA stock

## Insights I've Gathered
There is also a powerpoint included of an insight I found while looking into this data. Answering the question: **Does the Semiconductors and Internet Software & Services Industry in the IT Sector have similar expenditure for Cost of Goods sold in Year 2?**

Please feel free to check it out and play around with the profit and loss statement dashboard, you might find something interesting!
